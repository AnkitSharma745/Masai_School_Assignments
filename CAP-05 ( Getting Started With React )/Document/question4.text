Question 4: 

          Answer: Babel doesn't directly convert HTML code into valid React code. Instead, Babel is primarily focused on transpiling JavaScript code,
                 including JSX syntax, which is used in React components. 
                 JSX is a JavaScript extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.
                 Here's how Babel works with JSX in React:

                 1. Parsing JSX: When you write JSX code within your React components, 
                    it's not valid JavaScript on its own. Babel's role begins by parsing this JSX syntax and converting it into valid JavaScript code.
                     This step is essential because browsers can only understand standard JavaScript.

                 2. Transforming JSX into React Calls: Babel takes the parsed JSX and transforms it into a series of React function calls. 
                                                       For example, if you have JSX like <div>Hello, World!</div>, Babel converts it into something like React.
                                                       createElement('div', null, 'Hello, World!'). This is how JSX gets translated into React elements.

                 3. Transpiling Modern JavaScript: In addition to JSX, Babel also transpiles any modern JavaScript features used in your code, 
                                                  such as ES6 and ES7 syntax, into equivalent ES5 code that is compatible with older browsers.

                 4. Generating Output: Once all transformations are complete, Babel generates the final JavaScript code that can be executed by browsers.
                                       This code includes the React function calls and any transpiled JavaScript.
