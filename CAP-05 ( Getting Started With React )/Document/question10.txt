What is the meaning of render and root?
Ans. Render: In React , render refers to the process of converting react components into DOm elements
     and display them in the browser. 
     this method is typically used to render react elements into DOM. 
     it takes a react element and target container where the elements will be mounted 
     the render method is a crucial part of the react lifecycle 
     as it facilitates the initial rendering of the application and subsequent updates when the state or props of the components change 

  Root: the root refers to the root  DOM ode that serves as the entry point for a react application 
  it is the container element where the entire react componenet hierarchy is rendered and displayed 
  the root element is often specified as the mounting point for the entire application 
  using the ReactDOM.render method.
