Question 1. What is React ? 

   Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
           It's an open-source library developed by Facebook 
           that allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications with ease.
           React is known for its component-based architecture, 
           which makes it highly modular and reusable.
          
          Use Cases: 
                   React is commonly used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and
                   dynamic web interfaces. Some common use cases include:
                  1. Creating interactive web pages with real-time updates.
                  2. Building complex web applications with a clear component structure.
                  3. Developing mobile applications using React Native.
                  4. Integrating with other libraries and frameworks to enhance functionality.
          
          Benefits: React offers several benefits to developers.
                   1. Reusability: Components can be reused throughout the application, reducing redundancy.
                   2. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, 
                       making updates more efficient and improving performance.
                   3. Declarative Syntax: Developers describe how the UI should look based on the application state,
                                          making it easier to reason about.
                   4. Community and Ecosystem: React has a large and active community, 
                                              along with a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools.
                   5. SEO-Friendly: React can be used on the server-side to improve search engine optimization.
          Extra Information:
                            1. React was first released in 2013.
                            2. It follows the "one-way data flow" principle.
                            3. JSX (JavaScript XML) is commonly used with React to define the UI components.
                            4. React is often used in combination with other technologies,
                               such as Redux for state management and React Router for handling navigation.
